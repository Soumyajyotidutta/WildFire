## 2023 STUDENT DATA SCIENCE COMPETITION: WILDFIRE DATA SCIENCE CHALLENGE ##

[
### COMPETITION CHALLENGE

Data-driven wildfire research involves using data and statistical analysis to understand and predict wildfire behavior. This can include analyzing historical data on wildfires to identify patterns and trends, using remote sensing data to map and monitor fires in real time, and using weather and climate data to forecast fire conditions and potential fire spread. The goal of data-driven wildfire research is to improve our ability to predict and manage wildfires and ultimately reduce the impact of fires on human communities and natural resources.
